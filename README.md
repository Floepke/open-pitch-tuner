# open-pitch-tuner
Open Pitch Tuner is a tuner written in pixilang. It's goal is to analyse sound of any instrument that produces pitch and calculate the ideal stretched tuning. Just because it's cool to understand how all this works. There are a few commercial piano tuners that do this task. Open Pitch Tuner wants to be open as the name states already. The choice for pixilang is because pixilang is already aimed to audio and visual elements. There are built-in functions in pixilang that make it easier. Pixilang is just easy to understand. Another motivation to make this is my interest in tuning synthesized sounds in a mathematical way. That means that OPT wants to be able to record and calculate synths. I hope it will grow into a great working tuner!
